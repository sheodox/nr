# nr

This is a simple interactive selector for `npm` scripts. Use this if you know you need to `npm run` something, but don't remember what it is exactly, just run `nr` and filter/select your desired command.

## Setup

1. [Install Go](https://go.dev/)
1. Run `go build` to build
1. Put the binary somewhere that's in your path (like maybe `cp nr ~/.local/bin/nr`)
